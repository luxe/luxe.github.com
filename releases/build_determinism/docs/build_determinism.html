<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>When evaluating the determinism of building certain targets use this tool. It runs various bazel query commands to construct spawn information for all of the subcommands. These subcommands are analyzed for nondeterminism.</p>
<h1 id="installation">Installation</h1>
<p>Software can be installed through apt-get. The following commands will add the ppa and install the software.</p>
<pre><code>sudo curl -s --compressed -o /etc/apt/sources.list.d/build_determinism.list &#39;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/luxe/luxe.github.com/master/releases/build_determinism/build_determinism.list&#39;
sudo apt update
sudo apt install build_determinism
</code></pre>
<p>The debian file can also be installed/uninstalled directly. To uninstall you can use:</p>
<pre><code>sudo apt remove build_determinism</code></pre>
<h1 id="command-line">Command Line</h1>
<p>The tool can be used from the command line.</p>
<pre><code>constructs graph for third party dependance on a third party dependency:
  --dep arg             third party dep name (applied as &#39;@DEP//...&#39;)
  --run_dir arg         where to run the analysis
  --output_dir arg      the directory to output graph artifacts
  --bazel arg           the name of the bazel runner (useful if repo has a 
                        bazel wrapper or using bazelisk)
  -h [ --help ]         produce this help message
  -v [ --version ]      display version
