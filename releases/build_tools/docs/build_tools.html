<p>When evaluating what tools are used for building certain targets use this tool. It builds the target and shows which tools were involved in the target's creation.</p>
<h1 id="installation">Installation</h1>
<p>Software can be installed through apt-get. The following commands will add the ppa and install the software.</p>
<pre><code>sudo curl -s --compressed -o /etc/apt/sources.list.d/build_tools.list &#39;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/luxe/luxe.github.com/master/releases/build_tools/build_tools.list&#39;
sudo apt update
sudo apt install build_tools
</code></pre>
<p>The debian file can also be installed/uninstalled directly. To uninstall you can use:</p>
<pre><code>sudo apt remove build_tools</code></pre>
<h1 id="command-line">Command Line</h1>
<p>The tool can be used from the command line.</p>
<pre><code>test for build determinism on a particular target:
  --target arg           what you would pass to bazel build
  --url arg              git url to clone with
  --run_dir arg          where to run the analysis
  --branch arg           which branch to run the experiment on
  --synthesize_problems  synthesize the nondeterminism problems in a human 
                         friendly way
  --output_dir arg       the directory to output graph artifacts
  --bazel arg            the name of the bazel runner (useful if repo has a 
                         bazel wrapper or using bazelisk)
  --environment_scan arg try the A/B tests in different environments n number 
                         of times to evaluate any flakiness of nondeterminism
  --augment_scan arg     try the A/B tests with different augmentations on the 
                         environment n number of times to evaluate any 
                         flakiness of nondeterminism
  --verbose              show verbose progress
  -h [ --help ]          produce this help message
  -v [ --version ]       display version
