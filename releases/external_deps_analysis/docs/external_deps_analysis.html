<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>When evaluating the impact that a third party repository has on other third party libraries, use this tool. It runs various bazel query commands to construct a simplified and conceptual view of third party inter-dependence.</p>
<h1 id="installation">Installation</h1>
<p>Software can be installed through apt-get. The following commands will add the ppa and install the software.</p>
<pre><code>sudo curl -s --compressed -o /etc/apt/sources.list.d/external_deps_analysis.list &#39;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/luxe/luxe.github.com/master/releases/external_deps_analysis/external_deps_analysis.list&#39;
sudo apt update
sudo apt install external_deps_analysis
</code></pre>

<pre><code>sudo apt remove external_deps_analysis</code></pre>
<h1 id="command-line">Command Line</h1>
<p>The tool can be used from the command line.</p>
<pre><code>constructs graph for third party dependance on a third party dependency:
  --dep arg             third party dep name (applied as &#39;@DEP//...&#39;)
  --run_dir arg         where to run the analysis
  --output_dir arg      the directory to output graph artifacts
  --bazel arg           the name of the bazel runner (useful if repo has a 
                        bazel wrapper or using bazelisk)
  -h [ --help ]         produce this help message
  -v [ --version ]      display version
