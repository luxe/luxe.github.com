# Introduction
Noogle is like google but you get back numbers.  It runs various search engines, culminates the data, and provides you the most common numerical results shared across various websites.  For example, if you noogled 'us flag' you'd expect to get back 50 states.  For example, if you noogled 'snow white' you'd expect to get back 7 dwarfs.
