# Introduction
This tool evaluates a repository and publishes metrics about it.  It tries to be agnostic to how the repository is setup and what build system it uses.  Designed specifically for bazel repositories.  


# LDD Results
These are the dynamic libraries used by the program.  Use `apt-file search <file>` to figure out what package you may need to install.
